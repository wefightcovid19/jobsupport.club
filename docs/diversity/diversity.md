Diversity hiring is hiring based on merit with special care taken to ensure procedures are free from biases related to a candidateâ€™s age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and other personal characteristics that are unrelated to their job performance.

The purpose of this resource list is to help companies and recruiters navigate through diversity hiring. Letâ€™s come together and build an index of organizations, conferences, contacts, and other useful resources that value diversity.

Under the laws enforced by EEOC, it is illegal to discriminate against someone (applicant or employee) because of that personâ€™s race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.
